## Installation

### 1. Prepare the Environment
Please first install LLaVAï¼š

```bash
cd PreSel
git clone https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA.git
```

Then prepare the environment for LLaVA [here](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA).

## Dataset Preparation

### 1. Download the Datasets

#### LLaVA-665K Dataset
For the LLaVA dataset, please download the LLaVA-665K dataset following the instructions from the [LLaVA GitHub repository](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA?tab=readme-ov-file#train). This dataset is used for visual instruction tuning and contains a diverse set of visual-language examples.

#### Vision-FLAN Dataset
For the Vision-FLAN dataset, please download the data from the [Vision-FLAN website](https://vision-flan.github.io/#download). This dataset provides a comprehensive collection of visual-language tasks for instruction tuning.

After downloading the datasets, please place all data files in the `/datasets` directory. 

### 2. Preprocess the Dataset
We first add a unique index for each instruction in the original dataset, to better identify each sample:

```bash
python data_process/preprocess.py \
    --raw_annotation_path datasets/your_dataset.json \
    --new_annotation_save_path datasets/processed_dataset.json
```

This script adds a unique identifier to each sample in your dataset, which is essential for the data selection process. The processed dataset will be saved to the specified path. We will be using the json files with the unique_idx included in the code. 

Please note that as stated in the paper, for the LLaVA-1.5 dataset we remove the text-only instructions from the data, as our method focuses on selecting the images. You can either remove them yourself or use the already processed json file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j8qBxaHTiLVuBKX04Upsqlh7DdlguAfJ/view?usp=sharing).

### 3. Task Splits
For our method, we need to split the dataset into different tasks. We provide the task splits used in our experiments:

- LLaVA-1.5 task splits: [Download splits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17dSI8xZMcr4QvRz_qkWKR4RGSzrABHQm/view?usp=sharing)
- Vision-FLAN dataset: [Download splits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/yyy/view?usp=sharing)

Place the downloaded and unzipped task split files in the `data/` directory.




### 4. Reference Model Training
To estimate task importance values, we need a reference model trained on a small randomly selected reference dataset. You have two options:

#### Option 1: Use Our Pre-selected Reference Datasets 
For LLaVA-1.5 and Vision-FLAN datasets, you can directly use our randomly selected reference datasets (5% of images and their corresponding instructions from each task):

- LLaVA-1.5 reference data (randomly selected 5% images with instructions): [Download JSON](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ref_llava_5percent/view?usp=sharing)
- Vision-FLAN reference data (randomly selected 5% images with instructions): [Download JSON](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ref_vflan_5percent/view?usp=sharing)

Place the downloaded JSON files in the `data/reference/` directory.

#### Option 2: Create Your Own Reference Dataset
For custom datasets, you'll need to create a reference dataset by randomly sampling 5% of images along with their corresponding instructions from each task.

After preparing the reference dataset, fine-tune a LLaVA-7B model on it to obtain the reference model. For this step:

1. Download the LLaVA-7B checkpoint (before VIT stage) from [here](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-mlp2x-336px-pretrain-vicuna-7b-v1.5)


Fine-tune the LLaVA-7B model (llava-v1.5-mlp2x-336px-pretrain-vicuna-7b-v1.5 from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-mlp2x-336px-pretrain-vicuna-7b-v1.5)) using LoRA training following the script provided [here](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/scripts/v1_5/finetune_lora.sh)

This reference model will be used in later steps to estimate task importance values.
